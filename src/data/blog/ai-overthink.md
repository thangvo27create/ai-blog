# How I Use AI to Fight Overthinking (And You Can Too)

## Introduction

Overthinking is that relentless loop in your head—the constant replay of emails you sent, decisions you made, or what might happen tomorrow. It steals your mental peace, saps your energy, and turns simple choices into overwhelming puzzles.

If you’re like me, your brain spins too fast sometimes, making it hard to focus or just breathe. But here’s the thing: overthinking doesn’t have to control your day. I’ve found a surprising ally in AI tools that help me quiet the noise, organize my thoughts, and regain calm.

Let me share how AI helps me fight overthinking—and how it can help you too.

## My Overthinking Story

I always overthink emails before hitting send.  
I replay conversations in my mind, wondering if I said the “right” thing.  
Big decisions? They turn into mental marathons.  
Future plans? A tangled web of what-ifs.

It’s exhausting. My brain feels cluttered with half-formed ideas and worries. And the worst part? The more I overthink, the harder it is to get anything done.

That’s when I started turning to AI—not for answers, but for **a way to dump my swirling thoughts onto a blank page** and organize them without judgment.

## How AI Helps Me Calm and Clarify

### Writing Drafts & Brain-Dumping

When my thoughts run wild, I open **ChatGPT** and just type whatever comes to mind:

> “I’m worried about my presentation next week, but I’m stuck on how to start…”

ChatGPT helps me turn this mess into a clear outline or even a rough draft. It’s like having a friend who listens and then gently helps sort through the noise.

### Simplifying Complicated Thoughts

Sometimes I have a long, complicated idea that feels overwhelming. I use **Notion AI** to break it down into smaller chunks, turning my cluttered thoughts into manageable bullet points or action steps.

For example:  
> “Notion, help me simplify my goals for this month.”

And suddenly, my vague anxieties become clear tasks.

### Calming Anxiety & Reflecting

Apps like **Mindsera** provide AI-guided journaling prompts that nudge me to reflect calmly on my feelings—without judgment.

For example, a prompt might ask:  
> “What’s one thing I can control right now?”  

This helps me move from spinning thoughts to mindful awareness.

### Checking Tone & Decisions

When I worry about how I sound in messages, **GoblinTools** helps check my tone—making sure I sound confident and kind, not hesitant or harsh.

It also supports decision-making by listing pros and cons when I’m stuck between options.

## Daily Routines: How I Actually Use AI When My Brain Spins Too Fast

- **Morning brain dump:** I spend 5 minutes typing everything on my mind into ChatGPT. Then I ask it to create a simple to-do list from that chaos.  
- **Midday check-in:** If I feel overwhelmed, I open Notion AI and ask it to summarize my day’s tasks, so I know exactly what to focus on next.  
- **Evening reflection:** Before bed, Mindsera’s journaling prompts help me settle my thoughts and remind me what went well.  
- **Message prep:** Before sending tricky emails, I run drafts through GoblinTools for a quick tone-check and suggestions.

This simple routine keeps my overthinking in check and lets me regain control instead of letting worries control me.
