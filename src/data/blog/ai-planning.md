# How I Use AI to Plan My Day (Without Being a Techie)

## Introduction

Let’s be real: planning your day sounds easy—but doing it consistently? That’s a whole different story. Between a never-ending to-do list, distractions, and decision fatigue, I often felt like my days were running *me*, not the other way around.

Then I started using AI.

No, I’m not a programmer or tech whiz. I just wanted a way to stay focused, remember what matters, and stop wasting time. In this post, I’ll walk you through exactly how I use **AI tools to plan my day**—step by step. You don’t need to be a techie; just bring curiosity and maybe a cup of coffee.

## Step-by-Step: How I Use AI to Plan My Day

### 1. Start the morning with ChatGPT

**Tool:** [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)

Every morning, I open ChatGPT and type a quick prompt to kickstart my day. It helps me organize my thoughts, set goals, and get a rough structure in place.

**My prompt looks like this:**

> “Help me create a focused daily plan. I want to work from 9am to 5pm, include a 1-hour break, 3 deep work sessions, and some time to check email.”

ChatGPT responds with a super clear schedule, often with time blocks like:

- 9:00–10:30: Deep Work #1 (writing)
- 10:30–10:45: Short break
- 10:45–12:00: Admin tasks + email
- 12:00–1:00: Lunch
- 1:00–2:30: Deep Work #2 (coding or studying)
- 2:30–3:00: Errands or physical break
- 3:00–4:30: Deep Work #3
- 4:30–5:00: Review, wrap-up

Sometimes I ask it to include a motivational quote or a “3 wins of the day” reflection prompt at the end.

**Why it works:** It’s like having a productivity coach that never gets tired—and it only takes 1 minute to set up.

### 2. Organize everything in Notion AI

**Tool:** [Notion AI](https://www.notion.so/product/ai)

Once I have the structure from ChatGPT, I paste it into my Notion Daily Planner template. But the real power? Notion AI helps me **break tasks down**, generate reminders, and even draft journal entries if I feel stuck.

**Example prompt inside Notion:**

> “Break this task down into smaller steps: Finish presentation for Friday’s meeting.”

Notion gives me something like:

- Choose a presentation template  
- Write key points (1 hour)  
- Design slides (1–2 hours)  
- Review and rehearse (30 min)  

I can check off each one as I go. It makes big tasks feel way more doable.

I also ask it to:

- Rewrite goals in simpler words  
- Generate quick summaries of long meeting notes  
- Create templates for habits (e.g., morning routine, evening reflection)

**Why it works:** Notion AI keeps everything in one place—my calendar, goals, notes, even random thoughts. And with AI, I don’t waste time organizing or formatting.

### 3. Use Goblin Tools for the chaotic days

**Tool:** [Goblin Tools](https://goblin.tools)

This tool is a hidden gem, especially when my brain is fried or I'm feeling overwhelmed. It has a "Magic To-Do" feature that turns vague tasks into step-by-step checklists—instantly.

**Example:** I type:

> “Clean my apartment and prep for next week.”

It turns that into:

- Pick up clothes  
- Wash dishes  
- Take out trash  
- Sweep floors  
- Check groceries  
- Plan meals  
- Write short shopping list  

Plus, I can adjust the “spiciness” (aka detail level) depending on how much brainpower I have that day.

**Why it works:** It helps when I can’t even *think* about where to start. It removes the mental clutter and gives me instant clarity.

## Tips for Staying Consistent

AI tools are great—but only if you actually *use* them. Here’s what’s helped me stay on track:

### ✅ Keep prompts saved  
I keep a list of my favorite ChatGPT and Notion prompts in a Google Doc so I’m never starting from scratch.

### ✅ Use templates  
I have a Notion Daily Planner template with checkboxes, time blocks, and space for AI-generated insights. It takes less than 5 minutes to fill out.

### ✅ Don’t overthink it  
Some days, I only ask ChatGPT one thing: “What should I focus on today?” That alone keeps me grounded.

### ✅ Set reminders  
AI won’t help if you forget to use it. I set a phone reminder each morning that says: “Plan with AI – 5 mins max.”

## Conclusion

You don’t need to be a tech expert to use AI. You just need the right tools and a little curiosity.

AI won’t magically fix your entire routine—but it **can** make planning easier, your goals clearer, and your day feel more intentional. Even just 5 minutes with ChatGPT or Notion AI can shift your mindset from scattered to focused.

So go ahead—try starting your day with a simple AI prompt. You might be surprised how much smoother everything feels.

**Start small. Stay curious. You’ve got this.**
