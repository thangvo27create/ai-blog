# I Gave My Abandoned Ideas to AI – It Finished Them Better Than Me

## Introduction: Welcome to My Idea Graveyard

If you’re anything like me, you have a *graveyard* of ideas buried deep in Google Docs, Notion pages, or the Notes app on your phone — half-finished short stories, app concepts that never launched, blog series you meant to write but never did. They sit there, collecting digital dust, reminders of creativity paused.

I always thought those ideas were just… me being lazy or distracted. But what if they just needed a little help? What if a fresh perspective could bring them back to life?

Curious (and a little desperate), I handed a few of these abandoned projects over to AI. Here’s what happened.

## The Ideas I Passed On to AI

### 1. The Half-Baked Short Story

A sci-fi tale about a time traveler stuck in a loop, written in fits and starts. I had a few chapters and a rough outline but lost momentum.

**How I gave it to AI:** I pasted the existing chapters into **ChatGPT** and asked:  
> “Continue this story, keeping the tone suspenseful and the main character conflicted.”

**The result:** AI generated a gripping next chapter that actually surprised me. It added emotional depth I hadn’t imagined, and even foreshadowed a twist I’d never planned. It felt like the story *wanted* to be told.

### 2. The Unlaunched App Idea

A simple app concept to help people track daily gratitude, but the notes were just bullet points and sketches in Notion.

**How I gave it to AI:** I used **Notion AI** to expand my bullet points into a detailed feature list and even draft marketing copy:  
> “Describe the app’s benefits and create a catchy tagline.”

**The result:** Notion AI fleshed out clear user stories and suggested features I hadn’t thought of, like social sharing and mood tracking. The tagline? “Gratitude, simplified.” It made me actually want to build it.

### 3. The Forgotten Blog Series

A plan for five posts about “self-care hacks for busy people” — half of them just titles and random notes.

**How I gave it to AI:** I asked ChatGPT:  
> “Write an introduction for a blog series about simple self-care tips for people who never have time.”

**The result:** AI wrote a warm, inviting intro that felt authentic and personal. Then it even suggested outlines for each post, with practical tips. I felt inspired to pick up the series again.

## How It Felt: Amazed, Weirded Out, Inspired

I won’t lie—at first, it was a bit weird to see a machine “finish” my creative work. Sometimes the style was too polished, or the choices unexpected. But mostly? I was amazed. AI wasn’t just finishing tasks; it was *collaborating* in a way.

Did it do better than me? In some ways, yes. It gave my ideas structure, voice, and momentum I’d lacked. But it didn’t replace me — it was more like a second brain that helped me *believe* in those abandoned ideas again.

## Tips for Reviving Your Old Ideas with AI

- **Be clear and specific:** When giving AI your half-finished work, include style notes (“keep tone casual”) or what you want next (“write a conclusion”).
- **Break it into chunks:** Paste smaller sections instead of a giant file — it helps AI stay focused.
- **Use questions/prompts:** Ask for outlines, summaries, or expansions instead of just “finish this.”
- **Keep your voice:** Edit AI’s output to add your personal touch; it’s a collaboration, not a takeover.
- **Experiment:** Try different tools — ChatGPT is great for writing, Notion AI for organizing and brainstorming.

## Conclusion: A Second Brain for Your Creativity

Maybe those abandoned ideas weren’t bad or meaningless. Maybe they just needed a second brain to push them forward. AI won’t replace the spark that only you bring to creativity — but it might just help you fan that spark into a flame.

If you’ve got forgotten projects lurking in your digital attic, try handing them over to AI. You might be surprised how much better—and more alive—they can become.

Here’s to unfinished ideas, and the unexpected friends who help us finish them.
